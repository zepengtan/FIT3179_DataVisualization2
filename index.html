                    <p>The sudden decrease in cases in 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000 might be due to missing data. 
                        However, it is clear to see that abortion cases have <span class="bold">dropped rapidly since 2005</span>. 
                        According to studies, this might be due to <span class="underline">birth and pregnancy declines.</span> </p></div>

                    <p>Women aged <span class="bold">20 - 34</span> contribute the most toward abortion cases. 
                        This is logical as this is the period when young adults and adults are mature. 
                        They <span class="underline">might not want to settle down</span> and form a family, thus deciding to perform abortions. </p></div>

                    <p>The <span class="bold">South</span> has more total abortion cases in 2017, followed by the <span class="bold">Northeast</span>. These are New York, Maryland, 
                        District of Columbia, and New Jersey. Similarly, women aged 20 - 34 contribute the most in these states. </p></div>
                <div class="right-par">
                    <p>However, an interesting observation is that the rate of cases for women aged <span class="red">35 - 39</span> is higher compared to other states. 
                        Thus, this might lead to an overall high abortion case rate. </span>.
